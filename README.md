# HW equilibrium violation in human exomes
Identifying regions in exomes with excess of heterozygotes 

#### Note : This is an AI-assisted content


Within the human exome, specific regions exhibit a notable abundance of variants characterized by an excess of heterozygotes, ultimately resulting in a violation of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. GnomAD employs the inbreeding coefficient as a metric to identify instances where Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is breached, traditionally associating this violation with inbreeding.

While the inbreeding coefficient effectively detects regions influenced by inbreeding, it also serves as an indicator for areas characterized by an elevated level of heterozygotes and a marked depletion of homozygotes. Intriguingly, these regions are recognized for their suboptimal sequencing coverage, particularly in exome sequencing. The consequence is that variants within these regions, despite potentially harboring somatic mutations, may evade conventional filtration steps applied in analytical pipelines. These variants often pass through different filtering stages designed to exclude spurious variant calls.

The objective of this study is to systematically identify and catalog these stretches of DNA characterized by an excess of heterozygotes and a deficiency of homozygotes. By doing so, we aim to shed light on the unique characteristics of these regions, uncover their potential impact on variant calling, and contribute to a comprehensive understanding of genomic variations within the human exome.
